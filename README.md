### format_time()
The datetime module in python returns a date in %Y-%m-%d %H%M%S format.
However the Daraja Api Docs dictates the timestamp format be in %Y%m%d%H%M%S format.
The function converts the current time according to the Api requirements.

### decode_password()
It utilizes the base64 import that that encodes and decodes the password.
The password is the combination of a business shortcode, the passkey, and the formated time (Daraja Api Docs).

### generate_access_token()
This function authenticates the request mate through the customer key and the customer secrete through HTTPBasicAuth.
The GET request made to the safaricom through the access_token url, gives a response that has the access token and the expiry time.
The access token is then filtered out.

### mpesa()
This function makes a GET request through the api_url and in relation to our request body, a response is provided by safaricom.
